# Javascript-Quiz
This is for homework 4, the javascript quiz. It displays a quiz with some questions about javascript, and a timer. When the user answers all the questions, or the time runs out, the quiz ends. The user is prompted to save their initials and score (the score is the time remaining), which is then displayed in a sorted list.
